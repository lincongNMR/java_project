# java_project
Use Eclipse/Netbeans Java to run this program (Title called "Sourcejav"), following screenshot is showing this program running and output text. Please install the **newest version of Java (Java 8 update 121)**, because the program only support for Java 8 update 121. Usage *quote required (**JPanel**)* is only support for Java 8 update 121, the Java 9 also support for code "JPanel a = new JPanel()" but Java 9 does not support for code "JPanel a = new JPanel("blah blah blah")".

Alternatively, Eclipse/Netbeans can run like "killall java" to stop your program and Eclipse/Netbeans. This command when Eclipse/Netbeans GUI does not stops working,  do **not** run like "killall java" or "killall -9 java", but if Eclipse/Netbeans stops working, you need to run things like in terminal "killall java" or "killall -9 java". 

Using Eclipse/Netbeans, you also can type following command:

> sudo apt-get install netbeans eclipse

They are rarely install using those command, because it is similar to download it at web site. If you have an problem, please post as an issue on this project (not lincongNMR/java_project). The Java support does not use Eclipse to support Java Application, so you post them as an issue if you have an error and a problem you've encountered. Issue do not post as an question encountered, please post as an comment on a pull request.

Photos:
![alt text](0a.png "S1: Showing this program's photo.")
![alt text](0b.png "S2: Showing written in Java's codes and output text.")
Those photos are showing program shows what and program's output is what, does not show the code is what, and this is why we added photo to show what that program shows. But show a part of my code, not all code, because do it does not useful for showing my code is what.

# Others
Java Project is good for running in Debian/Ubuntu, and the ""sudo apt-get"" command is for Debian/Ubuntu. This project is under following usage:

>   a) Java Project does not add information in working days.
 
>   b) Java Project has an constructive calendar to see what day is constructive. (If that day is a constructive day, I can see this project. 
 
>   c) Java Project others does not have write permissions in issues to merge, only me can merge and close issues.
 
>   d) Java Project can see old descriptions when we added description.
  
Those usages are not a mess, d) saying we can see old description when we adding new description, c) saying issues only me can merge and close, b) saying we have an constructive calender in searching days in [GitHub](https://github.com). a) saying I don't add description on README on my working days, so this is why we called this "disambugation". Why we added that usage, because this project is different to other projects.
