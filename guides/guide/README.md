# java_project
Use Eclipse/Netbeans Java to run this program (Title called "Sourcejav"), following screenshot is showing this program running and output text. Please install the **newest version of Java (Java 8 update 121)**, because the program only support for Java 8 update 121. Usage *quote required (**JPanel**)* is only support for Java 8 update 121, the Java 9 also support for code "JPanel a = new JPanel()" but Java 9 does not support for code "JPanel a = new JPanel("blah blah blah")". Actually, this code is not using in Java 9, so you do not install Java 9 in this reason, but also you can install Java 8 when you are using "JPanel a = new JPanel("blah blah blah")" on a line. Download Java **8 update 161** also you can do, but safely you just to run the Java 8 update 121.

Alternatively, Eclipse/Netbeans can run like "killall java" to stop your program and Eclipse/Netbeans. This command when Eclipse/Netbeans GUI does not stops working,  do **not** run like "killall java" or "killall -9 java", but if Eclipse/Netbeans stops working, you need to run things like type "killall java" or "killall -9 java". The command "killall -9 java"/"killall java" to close all program written in Java, so do not do it in terminal.

Photos are not a instance of all of them code written in Java, it maybe a part, so we don't add all of them code written in Java. So this is why we don't insert photo all of them code written in Java, we insert photo a part of code written in Java, and we don't edit all of them code written in Java. Maintainly, this code isn't correct, so we removed from editing.

Two photos:
![alt text](0a.png "S1: Showing this program's photo.")
![alt text](0b.png "S2: Showing written in Java's codes and output text.")
Those photos are showing program shows what and program's output is what, does not show the code is what, and this is why we added photo to show what that program shows. But show a part of my code, not all code, because do it does not useful for showing my code written in Java is writing what.

Actually, this screenshot are showing a part of them code written in Java, not all of them code written in Java. It is no longer needed to take a screenshot, see my last sentence that is saying:

> But show a part of my code, not all code, because do it does not useful for showing my code is what.

Because that is not very useful, you can see my code written in Java when you installed Eclipse/Netbeans when you open the Explorer, so this is why we don't take a screenshot of my all is them code written in Java.

We does not have an instance for installation, so we add installation and usage description. I added usage before I added installation.

Following is the usage and installation:
## Installation
If you are no Java, download at here (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) but **need install Java 8 update 121** or please type following command (On Debian/Ubuntu):

> sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre

or:

> sudo apt-get install java

-->

If you are no Eclipse/Netbeans, install with following:

### Eclipse:
Download Eclipse at www.eclipse.org or using following command:
> sudo apt-get install eclipse

This command only support for [Debian](www.debian.org)/[Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com).
### Netbeans:
Download Netbeans at www.netbeans.org or using following command:
> sudo apt-get install netbeans

This command only support for [Debian](www.debian.org)/[Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com).

If you want to install all of them Eclipse and Netbeans, you also can type following command:

> sudo apt-get install netbeans eclipse

This command only support for [Debian](www.debian.org)/[Ubuntu](www.ubuntu.com). They are rarely install using those command, because it is similar to download it at web site.

or:

Download on website Eclipse(www.eclipse.org) then download on Netbeans(www.netbeans.org).
## Usage
