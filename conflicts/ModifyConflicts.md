At the same time, the conflicts ran to him can merge your commit. Your commits does not matter when the master branch when you merged an branch.

Merging are not possible because you have conflicts. Open your favorite text editor like Atom to fix them conflicts then run "git commit -m "Resolving conflicts"". So that is why we don't use the "git merge" command when we have conflicts to merge but it should be using the text editor.

At the same time, you can merge when you don't have conflicts. If you have conflicts, you should merge the conflicts in your favorite text editor such as Atom.
