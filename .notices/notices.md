# Notes - Only run on Windows 8 or higher and Ubuntu 14.04 or higher.
This is only run on Windows 8 and Ubuntu 16.04. If you run it on the lite mode, and then you have bugs to fix when your computer does not meet thes requirements and so that is why I had a new program to do it, and then I do create a program that is only run this when it meets it's requirements.
